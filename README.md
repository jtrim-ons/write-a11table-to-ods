# Write a11ytable to ODS

These are just some quick experiments to see if there's an easy way to write an a11ytable object to an ODS file.

`template/` contains the Mustache templates from the JavaScript package at https://github.com/jtrim-ons/accessible-spreadsheet-creator

`example/` contains some example files:
- a JSON file to feed to the Mustache templates. This was generated by the JavaScript package.
- the `content.xml` file, as generated by the JavaScript package.
- the ODS spreadsheet generated by the JavaScript package.

`main.R` creates the `a11ytable` from the {a11ytables} intro vignette. But it doesn't use this yet; it just reads in some JSON data and renders it using one of the templates. I'm hoping that instead of creating the `example_data` object from a JSON file, we can create it from the `my_a11ytable` object.
